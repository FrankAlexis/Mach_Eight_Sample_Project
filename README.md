# Mach Eight Sample Project

## Task

The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.
​
Sample output is shown below.

```bash
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
​
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
```

## Execution process

1. In order to execute the program is necessary to install the core libraries using the command line interface, described below:

```bash
> npm i
```

2. Then run the following command to execute the unit tests:

```bash
> npm run test
```

Note: Jest creates automatically a coverage folder after the execution with a HTML to visualize the results
